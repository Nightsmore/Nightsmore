### Welcome!

Hi! My name is Chris, I'm a Programmer and I.T. Professional. I grew up in Northern California, spending a nearly a decade breaking apart computers and learning how they function, I eventually put them back together, too. 

My strengths currently lie in developing in C# and the .NET Framework, a lot of ongoing projects being in Game Dev with Unity. One of my favorite subjects.
