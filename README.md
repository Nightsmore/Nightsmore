### Welcome!

Hi! My name is Chris, I'm a Programmer and I.T. Professional. My strengths currently lie in developing in C# and the .NET Framework, a lot of ongoing projects being in Game Dev with Unity. One of my favorite subjects.

I grew up in Northern California, spending a nearly a decade breaking apart computers and learning how they function, I eventually put them back together, too. In some of my free time I'll kick back and game with some friends, some personal favorites being Garry's Mod Rocket League and Counter Strike.
